# flutter_ddd_todos

It's a simple app, which was built by me, following this amazing [course](https://resocoder.com/2020/03/09/flutter-firebase-ddd-course-1-domain-driven-design-principles/) 

Nevertheless, it's not just copy and paste. I try to optimise and refactor the app, expand on the ideas that were presented in course.
